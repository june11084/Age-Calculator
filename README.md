# Age Calculator

This is an Epicodus friday project for Javascript that focuses on behavior testing using jasmine and karma, separating front end and back end using npm packages and gulp, utilizing ES6 features, and proper usage of .gitignore.

## Specs
1. Take a personâ€™s age in years and convert it into seconds.
2. Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.
3. Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
4. Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
5. Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
6. Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
7. Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet.
8. If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
